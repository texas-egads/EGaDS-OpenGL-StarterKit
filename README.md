# EGaDS! Super Simple OpenGL CMake Kit

Hey everyone! This is going to be a very simple way of setting up a basic 3D application using **C++** and **OpenGL**. This should give you a quick start in basic computer graphics concepts and allow you to start making cool games/projects using these concepts!

# Installation & Setup

In this step we're going to set up the project so we can start working.

Start by cloning this repository using the below command and follow the instructions below!

```
git clone https://github.com/texas-egads/EGaDS-OpenGL-StarterKit.git
```
> **Note:** Support for **Mac** builds is coming soon, for now it is not supported.

## For Linux
Make sure your system has the **necessary drivers** for your graphics card. Installation instructions for those depend on your distribution. Also make sure you have a **C/C++ compiler**. You can verify this by doing a check to see if you can see the compiler information.
```
g++ --version
```
Next you want to install some **dependencies** on your system, use the below commands to install those third-party libraries!
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake mesa-common-dev mesa-utils freeglut3-dev libassimp-dev
```
Now navigate to the local repository's main project folder and run these commands to **build** and **run** the project.
```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4
  ./EGaDS-OpenGL-StarterKit
```
The last command should do nothing since the **main.cpp** file in the template just returns 0. So you are good to go!

## For Windows
Make sure your system has the **necessary drivers** for your graphics card. As well you will need these **dependencies** for the project:
- CMake: To download and install click [here](https://cmake.org/download/):
- Visual Studio (or text editor of your choice): To download and install VS click [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/):

If you're using Visual Studio, open it and select **Open a Local Folder**, and navigate to the local repository's main project folder.

</p>

Wait for CMake, once it's ready, you can click the dropdown for **Build** and select **Build EGaDS-OpenGL-StarterKit.exe**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/1/VS-Build.png" alt="VS Build"/>
</p>

Awesome! Now you should have everything you need to start your project! Check to make sure you can use the dependencies in the **main.cpp** file!

# Creating a Window

Now that we have our project ready to go, let's start by creating a window. For that, we will be using the **GLFW** library.

## Setting up GLFW
We can first start by including **GLFW** at the top of our **main.cpp** file and let's include **iostream** as well!
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "GLFW/glfw3.h"
```
For those unfamiliar with C++ include formatting, 
- `#include <filename>` makes the preprocessor search in an implementation-defined manner, normally in directories predefined by the compiler. It's usually used for items that are in the standard library and other header files associated with the target platform. 
- `#include "filename"` also makes the preprocessor search in an implementation-defined manner, but one that is normally used to include our own header files and third-party libraries. Which in this case, is **GLFW**

Once that's settled, the first thing we need to do is initialize **GLFW** so we can properly use its functionality! 
```cpp
glfwInit();
```
So how **GLFW** works is it creates an **OpenGL** context, but we need to provide it with some information. This done using **Window Hints**. Let's give it some!
```cpp
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
```
What we are doing here is providing the version of our **GLFW** context and specifying our **OpenGL** context. From here let's create a **GLFWwindow*** pointer for our window!
```cpp
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 800, "EGaDS OpenGL Starter Kit", NULL, NULL);
```
`glfwCreateWindow()` Takes in several parameters that define your typical application window. You might be familiar with some of these settings in your everyday use of desktop applications!
- **Width**: This specifies the width of the window in pixels.

- **Height**: This specifies the height of the window in pixels.

- **Title**: This specifies the title of the window, displayed in its title bar.

- **Monitor**: This specifies the monitor to use for full-screen mode. You can pass a pointer to the desired monitor. If you are creating a windowed mode window, pass `NULL`.

- **Share**: This specifies the context to share resources with. You can pass the context of another window if you are sharing resources. For our purposes, this isn't important, so we pass `NULL`.

After this, we can add a bit of error logging and just print a little message to tell us if something goes wrong when creating the window. If that does happen, we can terminate **GLFW**.
```cpp
if (window == NULL) {
	std::cout << "Error creating window" << std::endl;
	glfwTerminate();
}
```

Now, in order to actually use the window we just created, we can use `glfwMakeContextCurrent()` and pass in our **GLFWwindow** pointer. This introduces the window object to the current context in **OpenGL**
```cpp
glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);
```

Then at the end of our application, we can destroy our window and terminate **GLFW**. This just cleans things up!
```cpp
glfwDestroyWindow(window);
glfwTerminate();
```
Now your **main.cpp** file should look something like this!
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main(void) {
	glfwInit();

	glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
	glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);
	glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);

	GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 800, "EGaDS OpenGL Starter Kit", NULL, NULL);
	if (window == NULL) {
		std::cout << "Error creating window" << std::endl;
		glfwTerminate();
	}
	
	glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

	glfwDestroyWindow(window);
	glfwTerminate();
	return 0;
}
```

Let's run our first window! If you have really good eyes, you might notice a window pop up for just a fraction of a second and immediately disappear! This is expected, so don't worry!

The reason this happens is because as soon as the window is created. We destroy it and terminate the program. This is why we will need a loop to keep our window open and running!
